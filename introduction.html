<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p align="justify">Fat oxidation kinetics during exercise are measured during an incremental
            exercise test and it is shaped as a parabolic curve across a range of
            exercise intensities, expressing the maximal rate of fat oxidation (MFO) and
            the intensity at which occurred the MFO (FatMax) [1].</p>

<p align="justify">MFO has been widely studied in recent years and may be considered to be a determining factor for endurance performance [2], with the better trained groups showing higher
          values of MFO, as well as an marker of metabolic health [3], with obese people having
          an impairment fat oxidation during exercise compared with their
          normal-weight participants.</p>

<p align="justify">However, the literature has focused on primarily on MFO and FatMax whereas
          the shape of these kinetics has been scarcely studied to this moment.
          As cardiorespiratory fitness affects MFO, it has been proposed that it can also
          influence the shape of fat oxidation kinetics resulting in a more dilated projection
          in better trained individuals [4]. For this purpose, Cheneviere et al [5] developed
          a sinusoidal model with three variables (dilatation, symmetry and translation)
          to characterized the shape of fat oxidation kinetics during exercise.</p>

<h4>The MFO Package</h4>
<p align="justify">This package has been developed to provide sports scientists a reliable and fast tool to estimate MFO and its kinetics.</p>
